			I create transcriptions as part of the general process of learning songs. 
			Sometimes they include other parts, mostly just the bass line.
			The general aim is for me to be able to replicate the correct rhythms of the track, in order
			to get the right feel in tandem with the drummer. When you have a lot of songs in your repertoire, 
			it's easy for them to start merging into each other! Hence, the scores are aiming for (more or less) note
			perfection - though when the bass line is heavily improvised on a theme, I may just put a repeat marker.
			<br />
			<br />
			The transcriptions are provided as is, without warranty, for personal practise use only. The copyright of the respective owners of any transcribed track is acknowledged, but no permissions have been granted (it's just too complicated to pursue at this scale).<br/>
			All transcriptions are created by me for my own purposes, and may include mistakes or be otherwise inadequate and are without any implied or explicit warranty or guarantee.
			Despite this, if you wish to provide cold hard cash in return for any or all of these scores, then please feel free to donate.<br />
			<br/>
			If you would like a specific track transcribing, I can do that for you, for the usual fee, plus expenses; as a guide, you would be looking at a minimum of 1 hour at 30GBP per hour.<br/>
			Send an email with your request.
